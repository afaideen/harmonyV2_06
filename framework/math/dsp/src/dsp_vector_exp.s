  DSP_VectorExp:

      void DSP_VectorExp(_Q16 *outVector, _Q16 *inVector, int N)

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_vector_exp.S

  Summary:  
    Computes the EXP (e^x) of the first N elements of inVector, and stores the
    result in outVector.

  Description:
    Computes the Exp value, e to the power of X, on the first N elements of
    inVector.  The output is stored to outVector.  Both vectors are _Q16 format,
    which is 32-bit data with 15 bits for the integer and 16 bits for the fractional
    portion.  If values exceed maximum or minimum they will saturate to the maximum
    or zero respectively.

  Notes:
    This function uses the Microchip PIC32MZ LIBQ library to function.  The user
    must include that library and header file into the design in order to operate
    this function.  For more information on the Exp function see the LIBQ documentation
    for _LIBQ_Q16Exp.
