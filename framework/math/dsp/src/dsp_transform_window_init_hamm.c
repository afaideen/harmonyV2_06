/*******************************************************************************
Microchip DSP Library
    Hamming Windows Initialization

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    dsp_transform_window_init_hamm.c

  Summary:
    Create a Hamming window.

  Description:
    Create a N-element Hamming Window, and store the output to OutWindow.  Operations
    are performed at higher resolution floating point, and rounded for the most
    accuracy possible.  Both 16-bit and 32-bit functions are provided.  Output values 
    are in Q15 fractional format and Q31 fractional format respectively.
    The Hamming Window follows the equation:

       Window(n) = 0.54 - 0.46 * COS(2*Pi*n/N)
         where n is the window sample number
         N is the total number of samples
    
   Notes:
    This function is performed in C.  The function may be optimized for the library.
    It is dependent on the floating point math library.
    The functional window is an intermediate result that needs to be multiplied
    by an input vector prior to FFT processing. Because of significant processing time
    the window need only be computed once and the multiply of the (window * input)
    vector done during recurring loop processing.
