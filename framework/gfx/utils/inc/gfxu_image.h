                                    GFX_Bool padBuffer);

  Summary:
    Preprocesses an image to a specified memory address.
     
  Description:
    This function preprocesses an image asset through the HAL pipeline
    and renders it to a given address, in a given color mode, and can pad
    the image buffer dimensions to be powers of 2 as required by some 
    graphics accelerators.
    
    This function is also useful for pre-staging images into run-time memory
    locations.
    
    The caller is required to ensure that the destination address is capable of 
    containing the result.  The size can be calculated by using the method:
    
    GFX_ColorInfo[destMode].size * img->width * img->height
    
    This function only works with images that are located in a core accessible
    memory location like SRAM or DDR.  If the image is located in an external
    source then GFXU_DrawImage should be called directly.  The caller will then
    need to service the media streaing state machine.  Once finished the
    image asset descriptor must be changed manually.  This function can be used
    as a reference on how to accomplish this.
     
  Parameters:
    GFXU_ImageAsset* img - pointer to the image asset to draw
    uint32_t destAddress - the address to render the image to
    GFX_ColorMode destMode - the desired output mode of the image
    GFX_Bool padBuffer - indicates that the image buffer dimensions should be
                         padded to equal powers of 2 (required by some GPUs)
    GFXU_MemoryIntf* read_cb - a pointer to a memory interface to use for
                               memory operations, not needed for internal
                               assets
    GFXU_ExternalAssetReader** reader - will return as a valid pointer if
                          the image asset is located in an external source.
                          If this is the case then the caller is responsible
                          for servicing the external asset reader state
                          machine until completion.  The caller is then
                          responsible for freeing the reader's memory.
  Returns:
    GFX_Result - the result of the operation
